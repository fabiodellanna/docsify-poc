Digital Commerce API [de-DE]
====================  

# 1 Swiss Post e-commerce API reference
The Swiss Post **e-commerce API** is a **REST** API which provides predictable and resource-oriented URLs and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. It uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with from a wide variety of environments, from command-line utilities, server-side or client-side web applications and mobile devices. It supports the **JSON** format in requests and it returns JSON content in all of its responses, including errors. It supports cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application.
The access to the Swiss Post e-commerce API is controlled by the **OAuth** authorization protocol. An **access token** is required to consume the **endpoints** exposed by the API. This is obtained after a sucessful authentication.

# 3 Authentication
The access to the Swiss Post connector and the e-commerce API is controlled by both **OpenID-Connect** protocol **version 1.0** and **OAuth** authorization protocol **version 2.0**.

Only Swiss Post registered clients can be authorized to consume the Swiss Post connector and the e-commerce API. The OpenID endpoint and some endpoints of the e-commerce API require the **authorization** of the end users when personal data is queried.

OAuth is an authorization protocol and not an authentication protocol. The client and the end user have to be authenticated; consequently the authentication is an implicit part of the protocol.

For more information see [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

## 3.1 OAuth
A client of the Swiss Post e-commerce API must first obtain an OAuth **access token** in order to consume the endpoints of the API.

* The client is authenticated by the OAuth credentials received after a successful registration: **client-id, client-secret**.
* A set of scopes need to be mentioned when ordering the access token, a scope corresponds to a use case applied on one or more endpoints of the API.
* These **scopes** must be a subset of the ones configured during the **registration** process.
* Moreover the end user may have to be **authenticated** and have to **authorize** the client for the set of ordered scopes.
* Finally an **access token** is returned to the client through a **redirection URL** configured during the registration. The returned access token is a **bearer token**.
* Depending on the implemented OAuth **flow** for the query of the access token, a **refresh token** is returned. This is used for access token renewal without user consent.

The OAuth authorization protocol defines a set of standard flows for querying an access token. A client of the Swiss Post e-commerce API is responsible for the integration of the desired flows in his use cases.

For more information see [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

## 3.2 OpenID-Connect
The access to personal data by a registered client through the Swiss Post connector is controlled by the OpenID-Connect protocol. This is based on the OAuth standard authorization protocol. The OpenID-Connect flow is based on the OAuth authorization code grant flow or the OAuth implicit code grant flow. It finally returns an ID-Token and an access token to the client.

* The returned ID-Token contains the personal data out of the identity of the end user mapped to each ordered OpenID scope.
* The returned access token can be used for consuming the standard Userinfo endpoint or the endpoints of the Swiss Post e-commerce API when eventually covered by the other ordered non-OpenID scopes.
* Both the returned ID-Token and access token are bearer tokens.
* With the ID-Token the client maybe already receives the full desired data at the end of the flow and is not forced to implement a subsequent call to consume the standard Userinfo endpoint.

A client of the Swiss Post Connector is responsible for the integration of the desired flows in his use cases.

For more information see [http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0.html#Introduction](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Introduction)

## 3.3 Authorization code grant flow
See [http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0.html#CodeFlowAuth](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth)

Flow meant for scopes giving access to personal data, requiring consent by the end user.

Some scopes giving access to non-personal data can be ordered besides the other scopes. They do not require any consent by the end user and are not displayed inside the consent screen.

If only non-personal-data scopes are used, it’s usually better to use the Client Credentials flow

### 3.3.6 Token response validation
We recommend that the client validates the token response, see [http://openid.net/specs/openid-connectcore-1\_0.html#TokenResponseValidation](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connectcore-1_0.html#TokenResponseValidation)

## 3.4 Client credential flow
This flow is suitable for the server-side access by a registered client to non-personal data. No consent by any end user is necessary for the ordered scopes, the client exchanges its OAuth credentials for an access token.

This flow is implemented on the server side.

### 3.4.1 Token request

      $ curl -X POST https://wedec.post.ch/WEDECOAuth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=wedec-fake-shop&client_secret=wedec-fake-shop-secret&scope=WEDEC_DELIVERY

    }  

## 3.6 Use refresh token
Refresh tokens are issued when access tokens are issued during the authorization code grant flow and client credential grant flow. It can also depend on the configuration of the authroization server.

A refresh token has a higher TTL than the associated access token. This refresh token is used for access token renewal without user consent.

### 3.6.1 Access token renewal

    $ curl -H Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW 
    https://wedec.post.ch/WEDECOAuth/token? 
    grant_type=refresh_token& 
    refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA  

## 3.7 End user’s personal information query (Login Post Connector)
### 3.7.1 Prerequisites
* OAuth access token for a set of OpenID scopes: openid, profile, email, address, phone. These scopes require the consent of the end user and can be obtained from an authorization code grant flow or an implicit grant flow.
* Each OpenID scope is associated with a set of OpenID claims, see [https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0.html#ClaimsNot AccessibleTarget not accessible](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims)
* Bearer access token stored in the header of the request:    
  Authorization: Bearer <OAuth access token>

### 3.7.2 KLP mapping
The standard OpenID claims (see [http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0.html#StandardClaims](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)) are mapped this way:

#### 8.2.1 Recipient’s address – maximum number of address lines (concerns the “GenerateLabel” request)

The number of address lines that can be printed on an address label is limited because there is a limited amount of space on the labels.

##### Rules when exceeding the maximum amount of address lines

When the maximum permitted amount of address lines is exceeded, address lines are omitted from the address label in the order below. This only applies to address lines from the “Recipient” address block and – if applicable and permissible – for free text:

1. Title (Title) is omitted
2. Address suffix (AddressSuffix) is omitted
3. Name 3 (Name3) is omitted
4. Free text (FreeText) is omitted

Please find some examples further down.

##### Data transmission

The information from the “AddressSuffix” address field element is not transmitted to DataTransfer, regardless of the number of address lines used.

##### “LabelAddress“ address block

When using the “LabelAddress” address block, you can define yourself which recipient’s address lines are to be printed on the address label and in what order for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 address lines (LabelLine1 to LabelLine5). An exception applies to the fields “ZIP” and “City” (and, for international mailings, also to “Country”), which are taken across from the “Recipient” address block. This means that you must define the procedure to be used yourself if the maximum amount of address lines is exceeded.

1 [↑](#bffn1) Delivery instructions are not possible for A7 format.

##### Examples for addressing rules for the “Recipient” address block

The examples below apply only if the “LabelAddress” address block is not used. Missing information in the recipient’s address is completed using the contents of the “Recipient” address block and – if available – the free text.

### 8.3 Printer resolution (dpi)

* 200 dpi (equivalent to 203 dpi on Zebra label printers)
* 300 dpi (equivalent to 305 dpi on Zebra label printers)
* 600 dpi (equivalent to 610 dpi on Zebra label printers)

### 8.4 Image formats / printer languages

* EPS
* GIF
* JPG (not recommended as barcode may not have high enough quality)
* PNG
* PDF[\[2\]](#ffn2)
* sPDF[\[1\]](#ffn2)
* ZPL2

1 [↑](#bffn2)  Format sPDF is a PDF file without embedded fonts. In order to display this format correctly, the Arial font must be installed on your computer. The generation and transmission times are faster with sPDF than with PDF.

2 [↑](#bffn2)  notime labels can only be created as PDF files.

### 8.5 Layout options for express items

The basic service barcodes for SameDay and Swiss-Express “Moon” services are printed in colour.

![](https://developer.post.ch/-/media/post-maxisites/developer/images/layoutexpressitem.jpg?mw=1600&vs=2&hash=8A903536E950E604C73E2708DC3A1C7D)

If there is no possibility to print the corresponding basic service barcode in colour on the address label, it can be printed in black and white. However, an additional, coloured basic service barcode must then be affixed to the item.

The coloured stickers can be ordered via [www.swisspost.ch/online-services](http://www.swisspost.ch/online-services) > Order forms & brochures.

### 8.6 Label generation time and file sizes

The time it takes to generate a label and the corresponding file size depend on the format selected, the printer resolution, the sender’s logo and the image format / printer language used. The speed of the Internet connection is also a key factor. It is therefore very important to have a fast connection. The table below gives some guideline values (measured with transfer rate of 45,000 kbps, without a sender’s logo). However, these do not take the data rate of your Internet connection into account, which could have a major impact on performance. These are average figures for formats A5, A6, A7 and FE.

### 8.7 Sender’s logo

The sender’s address must always be entered in the “Barcode” web service. You can hide the display of the sender details on the address label or display them as a text or image (e.g. company logo).

If using an image/logo, please note the following:

File size: max. 50 KB

File format: GIF, PNG or JPG

You can control how your image/logo is printed on address labels with the following four optional fields:

* Aspect ratio: Using this field, you can decide whether the original ratio of width to height should be maintained or scaled to 47 mm × 25 mm.
* Vertical align: Using this field, you can decide whether the logo should be aligned vertically at the top or in the middle.
* Horizontal align: Using this field, you can decide whether the logo should be aligned horizontally at the left margin or flush with the barcode.
* Rotation: Using this field, you can decide whether the logo should be printed in portrait or landscape orientation on the address label (clockwise rotation options: 0°/90°/180°/270°).

If no settings are changed in these fields, your image/logo will be automatically printed with the following settings:

* Scaling to the aspect ratio of 1.88 (image width: 47 mm / image height: 25 mm)
* The logo will be printed rotated anti-clockwise by 90°.

We recommend using a black and white logo for printing in the ZLP2 format.

#### 8.8.4 Notification with delivery management option

Offer your customers the option of individually controlling the receipt of their consignments with the status message "Proof of posting"or “delivery information”.

#### 8.8.4.1 Necessary fields

10 = Deposit consignment    
14 = Desired neighbour    
18 = Weekday    
20 = Forwarding

#### 8.8.4.2 Optimal data delivery

In order for the recipient to have as much time as possible to manage the consignment, we recommend ordering service 1 “Notification upon proof of posting”. By specifying the handover date of the delivery (“DispatchDate”) and the product description (“Przl”), the recipient can also be informed of the expected delivery date beforehand.

The “Notification with delivery management option” can only be sent by E-Mail.

If Swiss Post identifies the recipient as a registered user of the "My consignments" online service, he will not receive the notification with delivery management option. Instead, he will be forwarded to his login to access all services of "My consignments".

With the field "DynPic" your logo can be transmitted. This will then be displayed in the notification. The image can have the following formats: jpg, jpeg, gif, png. The ideal resolution is 640x160 pixels.

### 8.9 Printer models approved for “Barcode” web service

When your system receives them, you can forward the labels generated by the “Barcode” web service directly to a continuous label printer. This is possible with printer language ZPL2. In order for this to work, the printer models used must support ZPL2 as a printer language, otherwise the quality requirements of the labels will not be met.

Ideally you should use one of the printer models we have already homologated. To ensure adequate barcode print quality, you should always use high-quality shipping label materials. An overview of our homologated printer models is available at www.swisspost.ch/post-mypostbusiness-auftrag-druckermodelle.

Note also that shipping labels are printed in either landscape or portrait format, depending on the specifications of the homologated printer models.

### 8.10 Overview for service codes (DLC) – Domestic Parcels, Express and Solutions

#### 8.11.1 Posting BLN (electronic COD) via “Barcode” web service (for “Parcels” and “Swiss-Express”)

##### BLN-defined transaction types

If you already use the “Barcode” web service actively and would later like to programme BLN, we can provide a test environment for you. Please contact Web Service Support for further information.

The credit note for COD amounts can be applied by means of two different account types:

1. Yellow Account with inpayment slip (IS) from PostFinance, with upper limit on domestic transactions.
2. By Swiss Post ISR.

With transaction type 1 (yellow Account IS) only the COD amount is required. With transaction type 2 (Swiss Post ISR) both the COD amount and the ISR reference number is required.

##### ISR reference number

For the ISR reference number, the following data format is valid (excerpt from the PostFinance manual on “Record Structures – electronic Services”) [www.postfinance.ch/content/dam/pf/de/doc/consult/manual/dldata/efin\_recdescr\_man\_en.pdf](www.postfinance.ch/content/dam/pf/de/doc/consult/manual/dldata/efin_recdescr_man_en.pdf)

* Reference number
* 84
* 9(27)
* For 5-digit ISR customer numbers 000000000000999999999999999
* For 9-digit ISR customer numbers 99999999999999999999999999P
* Mandatory: The reference number is printed on the processing document in blocks of 5, whereby leading zeros can be suppresses. The details must be entered in the field with right alignment, empty positions must be extended with leading zeros. Reference numbers with the value “0” (zero) will be rejected. We recommaned that you recalculate and compare the check digit (modulo 10, recursive).

11 CORS
-------  

**Cross Origin Resource Sharing** is a relaxing technique for the **cross origin policy**. This policy is imposed by web browsers in order to minimize cross origin problems. It does not concern requests initiated on the server side.

Any client who wants to consume an endpoint of the Swiss Post e-commerce API from the client-side (for example with Javascript) will face the cross origin policy because the domains where the client and the Swiss Post e-commerce API are running are different.

The domain of the client must be registered in the CORS configuration of the API proxy server. This step is part of the registration process.
